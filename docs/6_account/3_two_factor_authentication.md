# Two-factor authentication

To improve the protection of your account, you should set up two-factor authentication. As soon as this is active, you must also enter the code displayed on your smartphone when logging in to the mosparo administration interface.

## Setting up two-factor authentication

To set up two-factor authentication, you need an authenticator app on your phone, such as Google Authenticator orMicrosoft Authenticator, or another compatible app.

Then use your smartphone to scan the displayed QR code or type in the displayed code manually. Then click "Next".

To confirm, enter the code displayed in the app in the corresponding field and click Verify.

If everything went well , you will see a list of recovery codes. Store these recovery codes in a secure location. If you lose access to your smartphone, you can still log in with these recovery codes and reset two-factor authentication or register with a new smartphone.

## Reconfiguring two-factor authentication

If you have a new smartphone or want to use a different app, you can reconfigure two-factor authentication. You then follow the same process as when setting up two-factor authentication.

## Reset recovery codes

If you have lost the recovery codes displayed during setup, or if someone else had access to them, you can have new recovery codes created at any time. To do this, click on the corresponding button and save the displayed codes in a safe place.

The old recovery codes are automatically invalid.

## Disable two-factor authentication

If you no longer want to authenticate with your smartphone, you can disable two-factor authentication at any time. Please note that you have to manually delete the entry of mosparo in the smartphone app, as there is no connection between mosparo and your smartphone.
