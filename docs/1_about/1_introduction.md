# Introduction

mosparo was founded in May 2021. We needed spam protection for a form on the homepage of a website. Because of data privacy, we wanted a self-hosted solution. So we started to search for spam protection solutions. While there are some solutions, a lot of these solutions use either a puzzle to recognize humans or are built into a system and are not available everywhere.

After some more research, we found that these puzzle solutions do not work for people with disabilities and are not accessible. Today, every website should be accessible – but when you have a form, you have to decide between accessibility, data privacy, and spam.

Because of this experience, we started to think about a new spam protection system that solves the problems with accessibility and data privacy and is free to use and installable on every normal web hosting.

mosparo – the **mo**dern **spa**m p**ro**tection – was born.
