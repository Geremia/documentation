## Testing mosparo

In order to test new mosparo developments on an ongoing basis, it is possible to use the Develop channel for updates. New developments are first tested in the Develop channel before they are officially published. Report any problems to us as an issue in the GitHub repository.

## Unit tests for mosparo

To improve the software quality of mosparo, we would like to ensure the entire functionality of mosparo with unit tests. If you would like to help improve mosparo, you are welcome to extend and improve our tests.

## Unit tests for API clients

We expect a function library to be fully tested with unit tests. We will not include function libraries in our list unless the function library has appropriate unit tests.
