# Rules

With the help of rules, mosparo recognizes whether a submission is spam or a valid submission. A rule type must be selected for each rule. Within a rule, any number of entries can be created, which are always based on the same rule type . A rule is always entered per project and cannot be automatically exchanged between projects.

## Creating Rules

To create a rule, select "Rules" in the navigation and then  select "Create rule" on the right. After that, a list of all rule types is displayed. Select the rule type you want to use to create a rule.

After you have selected a rule type, you see the editing surface of a rule. Give the rule a name so that you have a better overview when managing the rules.

In addition, you can enter a more detailed description of the rule in the "Description" field. You can also choose whether the rule should be active or inactive.

The Spam rating factor increases or decreases the entries in this rule. Each entry usually has a value of 1 by default. The spam score can be used to increase or decrease this value.

On the right side, the entries can be recorded. Depending on  the rule type, insert a value or select a value from the list (for example: Unicode block). Certain rule types also have types that you can select for each entry (for example: "Text" and "Regular Expression" for the rule type "Word").

With the "Add multiple entries" function, you have the possibility to enter a list of entries with just a few clicks. For example, you can insert a list of words in the field and create them as entries with one click .

The rating field defines the spam score of an entry. If the field is empty, the value 1 is automatically used. However, you can enter a value in this field that is greater than 0.

If an entry is no longer necessary, you can delete the entry with the delete symbol. However, the entry is only deleted when the rule is saved with the button at the bottom right.

## Managing the Rules

In the administration of the rules you will find all recorded rules. You can create additional rules by using the Create Rule button in the upper right.

In the list of rules, you can see the name of the rule, the rule type,  and whether the rule is active or not. You can edit or delete the existing rules if a rule is no longer needed.

Before a rule is deleted, you must confirm that you have deleted the rule.
