## Install a plugin

Please follow the instructions how to install a plugin on the website of the plugin.

Normally, you should be able to simply put the files of the plugin somewhere into your website and the website should detect the plugin.

After you've added the plugin, you need to configure it. For this part you'll need the information which you can find in the [project settings](../usage/settings).
