## More features

- In mosparo, you can enable a honey pot field, which can additionally help to protect your form from spam.
- Additionally, you can also enable a minimum time, which the user or robot need to fill out the form. Robots normally fill out your form within seconds – humans normally need longer to type all the data in your form.
- mosparo has also an automatic delay and blocking feature. With these features, you can delay or block the user for a specific time, if the user fills out the form multiple times. Multiple spam submissions from the same user within a short time can be stopped or at least limited with these features.
- The mosparo box in your form can be customized. You can choose all the colors, the general size and some other details about the box which will be displayed in your form. Since it’s a normal HTML element in your website, you could also use CSS rules to adjust it even more.
- mosparo is based on projects. This means, that you can use one mosparo installation for multiple websites. You just create a new project for a new website and connect the website with your mosparo installation.
- It is possible to import rules from a remote source. mosparo will automatically refresh these remote sources to get the latest changes.
- With the use of GeoIP2, mosparo can resolve an IP address and display the provider and the country of it.
