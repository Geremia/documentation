# Translating

## Requirements

- Please only provide a translation if the language is your native language (or you have comparable knowledge of a language). We do not want online translator translations.
- Please create a complete translation, i.e. all strings/pages in one area (for example: all strings in the frontend or all pages in the documentation), before you send us the translation.
- The code and your translation are published under the MIT licence. If you do not agree with this, please do not send us a translation.

:::note
As English is not our native language, we would appreciate it if you could report any mistakes or other problems in our English translations.

## Translating mosparo

### Frontend

The mosparo frontend has a few strings that are used for the mosparo box.

You can find the translation files here: https://github.com/mosparo/mosparo/tree/master/translations

The frontend translation files start with `frontend`.

Send us a pull request with your translation.

### Backend

The backend of mosparo has significantly more strings than the frontend. The backend is understood to be the administration interface of mosparo.

You can find the translation files here: https://github.com/mosparo/mosparo/tree/master/translations

The backend translation files start with `mosparo` and in the subfolder `validators`.

Send us a pull request with your translation.

## Translating the documentation

If you like, you are welcome to help us translate the documentation into other languages. To create a translation, you need to clone the documentation from Git and start a corresponding additional translation with Docusaurus.

Send us a pull request with your translation.
