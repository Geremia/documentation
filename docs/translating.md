# Translating

## Requirements

- Please only provide a translation if the language is your native language (or you have comparable knowledge of a language). We do not want online translator translations.
- Please create a complete translation, i.e., all strings/pages in one area (for example, all strings in the frontend or all pages in the documentation), before you send us the translation.
- The code and your translation are published under the MIT license. If you disagree with this, please do not send us a translation.

:::note
As English is not our native language, we would appreciate it if you could report any mistakes or problems in our English translations.

## Translating mosparo

### Frontend

The mosparo frontend has a few strings used for the mosparo box.

You can find the translation files here: https://github.com/mosparo/mosparo/tree/master/translations

The frontend translation files start with `frontend`.

Please send us a pull request with your translation.

### Backend

The backend of mosparo has significantly more strings than the frontend. The backend is understood to be the administration interface of mosparo.

You can find the translation files here: https://github.com/mosparo/mosparo/tree/master/translations

The backend translation files start with `mosparo` in the main translations directory and in the subfolder `validators`.

Please send us a pull request with your translation.

## Translating the documentation

You are welcome to help us translate the documentation into other languages if you like. To create a translation, you need to clone the documentation from Git and start a corresponding additional translation with Docusaurus.

Please send us a pull request with your translation.
