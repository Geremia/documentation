# Translating

## Requirements

## Translating mosparo

To make translating mosparo easier, we set up a [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) project:

https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/mosparo/

### Frontend

The mosparo frontend has a few strings used for the mosparo box.

Weblate: https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/mosparo/frontend/

We would like to have these strings translated into as many languages as possible because these translations are automatically selected depending on the browser and should include as many languages as possible.

#### Source code

You can find the translation files here: https://github.com/mosparo/mosparo/tree/master/translations

The frontend translation files start with `frontend`.

### Backend

The backend of mosparo has significantly more strings than the frontend. The backend is understood to be the administration interface of mosparo.

Weblate Backend: https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/mosparo/backend/ <br>
Weblate Validators: https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/mosparo/validators/

#### Source code

You can find the translation files here: https://github.com/mosparo/mosparo/tree/master/translations

The backend translation files start with `mosparo` in the main translations directory and in the subfolder `validators`.

## Translating the documentation

You can help us translate the documentation into other languages if you like. To create a translation, you need to clone the documentation from Git and start a corresponding additional translation with Docusaurus.

Please send us a pull request with your translation.
