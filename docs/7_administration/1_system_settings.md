# System settings

## Main Settings

You can configure various settings in System Preferences. The name of the mosparo installation is the name used in the page title of the installation and is also displayed as a name for two-factor authentication.

## Localization Settings

Configure the default values for language, date and time format as well as the time zone that your mosparo installation should use. Each user has the option to override these values for that user.

## Mail Settings

Enter the email address and the name that appears as the sender of an email.

You can also set whether the email is sent directly via an SMTP server or whether the sending is regulated by the server itself.
