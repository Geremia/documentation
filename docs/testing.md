# Testing

## Testing mosparo

It is possible to use the Develop channel to test new mosparo developments on an ongoing basis. New developments are first tested in the Develop channel before officially being published. Please report any problems to us as an issue in the GitHub repository.

## Unit tests for mosparo

To improve the software quality of mosparo, we would like to ensure the full functionality of mosparo with unit tests. If you would like to help improve mosparo, you are welcome to extend and improve our tests.

## Unit tests for API clients

We expect a function library to be fully tested with unit tests. We will only include function libraries in our list if the function library has appropriate unit tests.
